See `index.js` - pass in an image and a tracklist and basic functionality should just work.

## Running Locally

After installing dependencies, `npm start` to run the app.

## Deploying as a standalone static app

`npm run build` to create a `build.js`.

the `build.js` can then be checked into version control in a separate branch to run as a static/standalone webpage.

`npm run deploy` will do this for you and land you in your `gh-pages` branch which can be really convenient.
